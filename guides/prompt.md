### **Top 5 Posts**

Provide:

### **Insights & Learnings**

### **OUTPUT FORMAT (REPLICATE EXACTLY)**

Your output should follow the same structure as the sample report:

---

# **Period: [DATE RANGE]**

## **POSTING ACTIVITY SUMMARY**

A table with columns:
**Platform | Posts | Avg Engagement | Top Post | Status**

Include a **Content Mix %** breakdown at the bottom.

---

## **TOP 5 POSTS OF THE WEEK**

A table listing **# | Platform | Content | Engagement | Why It Worked**
Include 1–5 in ranking order.

Add a “Platform Winner” callout at the end:

> **Platform Winner:** [Platform] (X of top 5 posts, Y% above platform average)

---

## **KEY INSIGHTS & LEARNINGS**

A table with:
**Insight | Data | Application**

Make insights actionable (e.g., “Always use 5+ images”)

---

### **Formatting Requirements**

* Match the original report’s table formatting as closely as possible
* Maintain clean, concise language
* Keep tone analytic + professional
* Use percentages, averages, and comparisons when possible
* Keep “Why It Worked” short and insight-driven
